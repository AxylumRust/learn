## Learning Pathway for RISC-V
### Beginner 
For those with little or no knowledge of digital design. After going through these resources, you can go to the Intermediate section.


| Resource  |  Author(s) | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| [Digital Design and Computer Architecture RISC-V edition](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-Computer-Architecture-RISC-V/dp/0128200642/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1Y6VGCXHTB99I&keywords=digital+design+and+computer+architecture&qid=1659609065&sprefix=digital+design+and+computer+architecture%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-5)  | Sarah L. Harris, David M. Harris   | Covers the foundational knowledge of digital design and segues smoothly into RISC-V Processor implementation. Topics covered here include : *Number systems and digital representation, Semiconductors and transistors, Logic Gates and Digital Design, C Programming, RISC-V Architecture, RISC-V Assembly, Memory systems, Embedded I/O systems* |

### Design of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture

Andrew Waterman’s Doctorate of Philosophy dissertation in the University of California,
Berkeley, about the RISC-V ISA. It covers how RISC-V is a well structured small base ISA with a
variety of optional extensions, making RISC-V convenient for a range of purposes from research
and education, low-power embedded devices, to more general-purpose, high-performance computing,
with the existence of these optional extensions. It provides a comparison of RISC-V to other
popular ISAs as well.
