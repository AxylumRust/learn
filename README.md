## Learning Pathways for RISC-V

<a id="org5a672ea"></a>

### Beginner 
For those with little or no knowledge of digital design. After going through these resources, you can go to the Intermediate section.


| Resource  |  Author(s) | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| [Digital Design and Computer Architecture RISC-V edition](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-Computer-Architecture-RISC-V/dp/0128200642/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1Y6VGCXHTB99I&keywords=digital+design+and+computer+architecture&qid=1659609065&sprefix=digital+design+and+computer+architecture%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-5)  | Sarah L. Harris, David M. Harris   | Covers the foundational knowledge of digital system design and segues smoothly into RISC-V Processor implementation. Topics covered here include : *Number systems and digital representation, Semiconductors and transistors, Logic Gates and Digital Design, C Programming, RISC-V Architecture, RISC-V Assembly, Memory systems, Embedded I/O systems* |
| [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) | Noam Nisan, Shimon Schocken | A free hands-on tutorial on building a general-purpose computer from logic gates using a hardware simulator. |

### Intermediate 
For those with some background in digital system design.


| Resource  |  Author(s) | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| [Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition: The Hardware Software Interface (2nd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-RISC-V-Architecture/dp/0128203315/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) | David A. Patterson, John L. Hennesy | Covers the RISC-V Instruction Set in general and does an in-depth examination of the core RISC-V instructions. It also does a deep dive into RISC-V processor implementations. Each chapter includes real-world applications by tying concepts discussed with available modern computers. The book also highlights the interactions between hardware and software by continuously optimizing a software program to take advantantage of new hardware concepts introduced in each chapter. |

### Design of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture

Andrew Waterman’s Doctorate of Philosophy dissertation in the University of California,
Berkeley, about the RISC-V ISA. It covers how RISC-V is a well structured small base ISA with a
variety of optional extensions, making RISC-V convenient for a range of purposes from research
and education, low-power embedded devices, to more general-purpose, high-performance computing,
with the existence of these optional extensions. It provides a comparison of RISC-V to other
popular ISAs as well.
