A community-driven compilation of RISC-V resources and learning material. The list is dynamically
updated by the community and categorized based on different contexts of the RISC-V scope, taking
also into account different levels of experience/knowledge, allowing anyone interested in RISC-V to
discover RISC-V resources and relevant content (courses, software, documentation, articles etc.) in
an organized fashion.

Feel free to navigate through the resources listed below with their descriptions.

# âž• Making Contributions

We love contributions, so thanks for your interest in contributing to our RISC-V resources compilation repo. We are currently focused on adding tutorial resources that teach newcomers about RISC-V. You could either provide more information for the available resources on our list or add new resources to the list.

Contributing is easy, here are some steps to help get you started:

âœ” Browse through the [list of available resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hi62TPnl58R4lDX3wVw9_T78ylY21mI7B5Qb04ewLRE/edit#gid=0).

âœ” Open an Issue and in the comment, include the following: 
- resource name 
- description 
- resource link
- prerequisite knowledge required to comprehend the resource content.

âœ” Engage with an already open issue

We may interact with you before adding your contributions.

### Intermediate 
For those with some background in digital system design.


| Resource  |  Author(s) | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| [Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition: The Hardware Software Interface (2nd edition)(Amazon book link)](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-RISC-V-Architecture/dp/0128203315/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) | David A. Patterson, John L. Hennesy | Covers the RISC-V Instruction Set in general and does an in-depth examination of the core RISC-V instructions. It also does a deep dive into RISC-V processor implementations. Each chapter includes real-world applications by tying concepts discussed with available modern computers. The book also highlights the interactions between hardware and software by continuously optimizing a sample software program based on the new hardware concepts introduced in each chapter. |

### Design of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture

Andrew Watermanâ€™s Doctorate of Philosophy dissertation in the University of California,
Berkeley, about the RISC-V ISA. It covers how RISC-V is a well structured small base ISA with a
variety of optional extensions, making RISC-V convenient for a range of purposes from research
and education, low-power embedded devices, to more general-purpose, high-performance computing,
with the existence of these optional extensions. It provides a comparison of RISC-V to other
popular ISAs as well.
