A community-driven compilation of RISC-V resources and learning material. The list is dynamically
updated by the community and categorized based on different contexts of the RISC-V scope, taking
also into account different levels of experience/knowledge, allowing anyone interested in RISC-V to
discover RISC-V resources and relevant content (courses, software, documentation, articles etc.) in
an organized fashion.

Feel free to navigate through the resources listed below with their descriptions.

## âž• Making Contributions

We love contributions, thank you for your interest in contributing to our RISC-V resources compilation repository. We are currently focused on adding tutorial resources that teach newcomers about RISC-V. You could either provide more information for the available resources on our list or add new resources to the list. Contributions are made in the form of resource suggestions, and can be done by filling out an issue form provided in this repository.

Contributing is easy, here are some steps to help get you started:
<!-- In this section we could remove the list of available resources page -->
âœ” Browse through the [list of available resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hi62TPnl58R4lDX3wVw9_T78ylY21mI7B5Qb04ewLRE/edit#gid=0).
<!-- In this section we will add a hyperlink that directs to the issue page -->
âœ” Open an issue and include the following information in the relevant fields: 
- resource name 
- description 
- resource link
- prerequisite knowledge required to comprehend the resource content.

âœ” Engage with an already open issue

We may interact with you before adding your contributions.

| **Nand2Tetris** | Noam Nisan, Shimon Schocken | A free hands-on tutorial on building a general-purpose computer from logic gates using a hardware simulator. | [[webpage]](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) |

<a id="intermediate"></a>

#### Intermediate 
For those with some background in digital system design.


| Resource  |  Author(s) | Description  | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Computer Organization and Design RISC-V edition: The Hardware Software Interface (2nd edition)** | David A. Patterson, John L. Hennesy | Covers the RISC-V Instruction Set in general and does an in-depth examination of the core RISC-V instructions. It also does a deep dive into RISC-V processor implementations. Each chapter includes real-world applications by tying concepts discussed with available modern computers. The book also highlights the interactions between hardware and software by continuously optimizing a sample software program based on the new hardware concepts introduced in each chapter. | [[Amazon book link]](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-RISC-V-Architecture/dp/0128203315/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) |

### Relevant Documentation from RISC-V International

| Resource | Description | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Member Benefits and Welcome deck** | A set of slides useful for new RISC-V members to familiarize themselves with the scope/organization of the RISC-V community and learn about membership benefits, as well as how to integrate into the community as a member. |  [[Google Doc]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q8gMcVwzqdqym3ugl_Q-LW0KMUApO-v8mWVdjqQE-MI/edit#slide=id.gf097992cc3_0_1819) |
| **Getting Started Guide for RISC-V Members** |This document is intended to give a memberâ€™s overview of the RISC-V technical organizations. The intended audience is both for new members as well as a reference for existing members.| [[Google Doc]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qjf6BwMmtqTfzftr3WWf2bRv8Cl4f0qZrWWbr0jCBSU/edit) |
| **RISC-V Technical Wiki** |This page serves as the main anchor point for the most important pieces of technical information for RISC-V. If you're looking for something technical, start here.| [[webpage]](https://wiki.riscv.org) |
| **RISC-V Lifecycle Guide** |This document has been created to facilitate RISC-V member participation in the key activities involved in creating and running groups, writing of specifications, and contributing open-source software in support of RISC-V architectures.  It is a guide, not the rules. | [ [Google Doc]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Au3veNdNJQKPq-oiQRKTzdgmM72FDaqZOKeH7sOnG04/) |

### Articles and presentations

| Resource  |  Author(s) | Description  | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Design of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture** |Andrew Waterman|Andrew Watermanâ€™s Doctorate of Philosophy dissertation in the University of California, Berkeley, about the RISC-V ISA. It covers how RISC-V is a well structured small base ISA with a variety of optional extensions, making RISC-V convenient for a range of purposes from research and education, low-power embedded devices, to more general-purpose, high-performance computing, with the existence of these optional extensions. It provides a comparison of RISC-V to other popular ISAs as well.| [ [pdf]](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2016/EECS-2016-1.pdf) |
